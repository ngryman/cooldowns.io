# cooldowns.io <sup>v0.0.2</sup>

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ngryman/cooldowns.io.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## Motivations

I love [League of Legends] and [jungling].
So I made this little tool to manage correctly every important jungle's cooldowns.

Some great tools already exist but I wanted a simple, mobile friendly version.
You can access to [cooldowns.io] on any device with a modern browser.
It even works offline.

Good jungling!
